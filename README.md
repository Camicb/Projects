# Travel Insurance Claim Prediction

Many companies selling tickets or travel packages, give consumers the option to purchase travel insurance, also known as travelers insurance. Travel insurance is a type of insurance that covers the costs and losses associated with traveling. It is useful protection for those traveling domestically or abroad. Some travel policies cover damage to personal property, rented equipment, such as rental cars, or even the cost of paying a ransom.

The objective of this project is to create a machine learning model for a insurance company to predict if the insurance buyer will claim their travel insurance or not.

This project was part of an assignment for a Machine Learning Bootcamp conducted by DPhi last year. The datasets were provided freely by them.

In the [first version](https://github.com/Camicb/practice-1/blob/main/Travel_Insurance_Claim_Prediction.ipynb) of this project, I experimented with traditional classification models, so I will try different approaches here for educational purposes.
